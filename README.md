# What is Tailwind

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework. In contrast to other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize CSS it doesn't come with predefined components. Instead Tailwind CSS operates on a lower level and provides you with a set of CSS helper classes.

# What do I need to use Tailwind

- To use Tailwind you need [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A code editor of choice. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
